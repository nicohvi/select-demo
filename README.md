# Custom select

This repository shows how you can create a custom select list
with HTML that suits a Rails form (to see how you can render this
using Rails, please see [this blog post](https://www.nico.cool/blog/2017/05/03/custom-rails-select).

To view the demo run `npm install` then `npm run build` and finally
open the `index.html` file in your browser.
